# Unofficial_Tec_Transcript_Generator

## Project Description
Unofficial Tec Transcript is a web application designed to help Tec students obtain an unofficial transcript, which is often required for various processes such as applying for internships. With this app, students can log in with their credentials and select their career path. The app then displays a window with information on the subjects related to their chosen career path and semester.

Once the student has filled in all the necessary information, the app generates a preview of the transcript, which can be downloaded as a PDF. Additionally, if the student agrees to receive notifications, they will receive an email each time they finish a semester, reminding them to update their unofficial transcript.

This app streamlines the process of obtaining an unofficial transcript, making it easier and more convenient for Tec students to meet their academic and professional needs.
